# Poker AI PRD4 - Critical Review & Gap Analysis

## üéØ Executive Summary

The PRD is comprehensive but suffers from **over-engineering** for an offline 3-player poker game. The document reads like a production enterprise system rather than a focused AI project. Significant simplification opportunities exist.

  - RAM needs for ML models?
  - Storage requirements?
  - Screen resolution dependencies?

 Answer : read the PRD and define them for a 16ram, 1080ti nvidia, storage to be defined by the project, your call. screen resolution 1920x1080 to start.

### **4. Model Training Strategy**
- **What's Missing**: Concrete training approach
- **Critical Questions**:
  - How to train with only 3-player data?
  - Opponent diversity in training?
  - How much manual training data needed?
  - Transfer learning from online poker datasets?

  Answer : futures updates 

### **5. Poker Strategy Implementation**
- **What's Missing**: Actual strategic framework
- **Critical Questions**:
  - GTO solver to use (PioSOLVER, GTO+)?
  - Preflop ranges for 3-player?
  - Postflop decision trees?
  - Bankroll management rules?

  Answer : define basic rules

## ‚ö° Quick Start Questions

**Before any implementation begins, answer these:**

1. **What does your offline poker client look like?** (Screenshots needed) answer : check the client screenshot folder
2. **What are the exact game rules?** (Betting structure, blinds, etc.) no limite holdem, blind increase every 1min or so, what else ? 
3. **What's your target hardware?** (Laptop specs, resolution) 1920x1080
4. **How much manual training are you willing to do?** (Hours/days) hours / days
5. **What's your success criteria?** (Win rate target, timeframe) 60%

## üéØ Bottom Line

The current PRD is **300% more complex than needed** for an offline 3-player poker game. Focus on:

1. **Vision accuracy** (card/chip recognition)
2. **Basic strategic play** (tight-aggressive)
3. **Simple timing variation** (human-like delays)
4. **Essential logging** (hand history)

Everything else can be added later if needed.
